Useful Angular Libraries

 - Angular Material

 - ng-bootstrap (should be already in use)

 - ngx-bootstrap (extends ng-bootstrap as far as I can tell)

 - PrimeNG (useful for data tables, sorting, filtering etc.)
	=> DynamicDialog and DataView may be especially useful for EKart Project
	=> Divider may be useful for login + sign up
	=> Table/sort may be useful
	=> Sticky is also very nice for tables
	=> InputGroup can be useful for username and password input fields
	=> Password will be useful for password input fields (obviously). 
		Has nice strenth meter plus visibility toggle
