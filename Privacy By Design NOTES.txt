Privacy by design Notes

	Personal Data vs Sensitive Personal Data
		- Examples for Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
			- name, contact details, DoB, Gender, email, photograph, Marital Status, cookies, Ip Address
			location details, CCTV images, website visit logs
		- Examples for Sensitive Personal Information (SPI)
			- health/medical data, Criminal record, biometric, financial details

	What is data processing?
		- recording, usage, collection, viewing, storage, organizing, disclosure, alteration, retrivial,
		destruction etc.

	Data Privacy Terminologies
		- Controller: Entity that determines the purpose and means of data processing
		- Processor: Entity that processes data on behalf of data controller

	Data Privacy Principles
		- Accountability
		- Fair, Lawful, Transparent
		- Security
		- Storage limitation
		- Accuracy
		- Data minimization
		- Purpose limitation

	Privacy by Design - 7 Principles
		- Proactive not reactive; Preventative not remedial 
		- Privacy as the Default Setting
		- Privacy Embedded into Design (Not bolted on as add-ons)
		- Full Functionality: Positive-sum (win-win) NOT zero-sum
		- Respect for User Privacy: Keep it User-centric (Gives control of their data to users and 
			garuntees privacy of processing)
		- Visibility and Transparency: Keep it open
		- End-to-end Security: Full Lifecycle Protection
		
	Privacy by Design Objectives
		- Predictability: Both application owners and data subjects have complete visibility of what is 
		happening with the personal data
		- Manageability: Is the control offered to the data subject over his/her data on all layers of 
		the data life cycle?	
		- Disassociability: anonymization, de-identification, pseudonymization, data masking, cryptography


	PbD Implementation
		- Unlinkability -> Data Oriented (minimize, hide, seperate, abstract)
		- Intervenability -> Process Oriented (Control, Enforce, Demonstrate)
		- Transparancy -> Process Oriented (Inform)

		Privacy Design Patterns
			- Resusuable components
			- Privacy Enhancement Technologies (PET)

	Minimize Tactics
		- Select: Only relevant information collected and processed (ie. whitelist) 
			-> Collect only date a month of birth. Year is not required
		- Exclude: Exclude data subjects and attributes unless absolutely necessary (ie. blacklist) 
			-> Not collecting emergency contact details during application stage
		- Strip: Partially eliminate personal data as soon as it is no longer necessary 
			-> Collecting address details only when customer is making a purchase
		- Destroy: Completely delete personal data as soon as it is no longer needed such that it cannot 
			be recovered
			-> If DB table has several PII with different retention periods, need to seperate into differnt tables faciliate deletion

		Design Patterns:
			- Online template to capture only PII that is necessary.
			- Auto data deletion script
			- Psuedonymization
			- Anonymization
			- Privacy settings: Opt in/ Opt out for marketing
			- Cookie Controls
			- Dynamic location granularity
			- Do Not Track
		
	Seperate Tactics
		- Isolate: Collect and process personal data in different databases or applications 
			-> Fingerprint biometric is stored on the card and not on central servers
		- Distribute: Distribute data over different physical locations using databases and systems 
			-> CCTV footage is stored in respective country servers

		Design Patterns:
			- Decentralize or destributed architecture
			- Secure multi-party computation
			- Shift some amount of the processing of personal data to the user-trusted environments (eg. their own devices)

	Abstract Tactics:
		- Summarize: Generalize values by using ranges rather than exact values 
			-> Use Age range
		- Group: Aggregate information 
			-> location data need not be exact
		- Perturb: Use approximate values or modify real values with random noise 
			-> Use synthetic data for testing

		Design Patterns:
			- Dynamic location granularity
			- K-anonymity by generalization
			- Differential privacy -> adding noise to data set
			- Homomorphic encryption allows one to perform calculations on encrypted data without learnign the real data themselves

	Hide Tactics:
		- Restrict: Access control policy on "Need to know" 
			-> Supporting documents for sick leave on GLS should be accessible only to HR
		- Obfuscate: Encryption and hashing techniques to make data unintellibigle while at rest or in transit 
			-> IRM on downloadable reports containgin PII
		- Dissociate: Eliminate the link between datasets 
			-> Encryption of health data in database
		- Mix: Group together information on various subjects to avoid correlations 
			-> On iTravel, Manager who approves travel request need not see employees' address which can only be shown to cab driver

		Design Patterns:
			- Encryption
			- Access Control
			- Data masking
			- Onion Routing 

	Inform Tactics:
		- Supply: Providing data subjects with details on how data is processed/used 
			-> An email is sent to the employee by HR to ensure their data is up to date and accurate
		- Explain: in clear language, what data is recorded and for what purpose, how long it's retained etc. 
			-> Privacy Pictograms to make it easier to understand
		- Notify: In case of data breach, notify data subjects 
			-> Have a notification icon in the status bar whenever an application accesses the location service
		- Alert: Provide real-time notification when personal data is being collected

		Design Patters:
			- Website privacy policy
			- Privacy notice/consent at the point of data collection
			- Layered Privacy Policy
			- Data breach notification
			- Privacy Dashboard
			- Privacy icons

	Control Tactics:
		- Consent: Ask users explicit consent for obtaining and processing information. Should be possible 
			to withdraw consent at any time
			-> Sending newsletters to customers only if they opt-in
		- Choose: Offer users a real choice 
			-> If a website is collecting geo location, or a website palces 3rd party cookies, they must be based on choice and consent
		- Update: Offer users the means to update and review the personal information about themselves 
			-> When shopping portal obtains wedding anniversary date, from a buyer, it must be based on consent and should be optional
		- Retract: Offer uses a means to withdraw or ask for deletion of their personal data

		Design Patterns:
			- Selective disclosure
			- Privacy settings: Opt-in/Opt-out for marketing
			- Cookie Control banners
			- Consent management
			- Privacy dashboard
			- DSR management

	Enforce Tactics:
		- Create: Organization should commit to privacy, take responsiblity, create a privacy policy,  
			assign resources to execute this policy and have training and awareness around privacy 
			-> implementing privacy management models such as ISO 27701:2019 standard
		- Maintain: Implement necessary controls to maintain the privacy policy and ensure third parties comply
			-> Perform privacy impact assessments
		- Uphold: Verify privacy policy regularily and update it's implementation whenever necessary

		Design Patterns:
			- DP Office
			- PIA tools
			- Governance
			- Access Control
			- Obligation Management

	Demonstrate Tactics:
		- Record: Maintain records of processing activities, collect logs, record consent taken and acknowledgement 
			of notices
			-> get certified against recognized privacy standard. Benchmark with other organizations that operate in same business context
		- Audit: Carry out indepenedent review of the degree of compliance with org DP policy and
			regulatory and contractual obligations
		- Report: Report processing activies to DPA where required

		Design Patterns:
			- PII/SPI Logging
			- Consent records
			- Audits
			- Data inventory
